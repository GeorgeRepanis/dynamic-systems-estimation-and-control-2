Assignment 1 for *Simulation & Modeling of Dynamical Systems*: linearized torque-driven pendulum modeled in state-space and transfer-function form, simulated under sinusoidal input. Implements Least Squares to estimate unknown parameters (m, L, c) from measured signals, and studies estimation quality under (i) different measured sets, (ii) white Gaussian noise, (iii) sampling period (T_s), and (iv) input amplitude (A_0). Includes notes, plots, and discussion of errors and sensitivity.
