Assignment for **Simulation & Modeling of Dynamical Systems** focusing on real-time estimation and control. Part 1 implements gradient and Lyapunov-based (parallel & mixed) estimators on a mass–spring–damper model, comparing constant vs. sinusoidal excitation and studying noise sensitivity.  Findings include good output tracking, convergence behavior of parameters, and a notable error jump near (n_0 \approx 0.05) with stabilization at higher noise levels.  Part 2 designs a roll-angle controller for an aircraft with transformed errors (z_1, z_2), targets a (0 \to \pi/10 \to 0) profile in 20 s, and adds Lyapunov-based online parameter estimation and disturbance tests.  Includes simulations, plots, and concise commentary.
